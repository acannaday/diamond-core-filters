Building SnapFind
-----------------

Before starting you need to have built and install opencv 0.9.5.  Snapfind
requires that you build opencv with static libraries.  This can be done
at opencv configuration time by: 

  	./configure --enable-static=yes


Once this is installed you also need to have built the diamond
system.  This does not need to be install but you must specify
it's path to the configure script (if building from CVS run
autoconf at the top of the source tree to generate the configure).

Then run configure 

	./configure --with-diamond=/somepath

where /somepath is the top of the diamond build directory 
("somedir/diamond/target" if using the build tree).
Once configure successfully builds, then build SnapFind 
using "make" at the top level.  If all goes well
the system should build.  The libraries, includes, and binaries
will be places in target/{lib,include,bin}. 


Running Snapfind
----------------
To run SnapFind you must have two configurations files.  The first
is called "gid_map" and the second is called "name_map".  The name_map
groups logical collections of files into one or more group numbers. 
Snapfind allows the user to select the groups id to search.  There must be
at least 1 collection defined.  The gid_map file is used to map
the each group to 1 or more diamond back-ends (IP addresses).  
If running standalone this should map the group to localhost, 
if running across a distributed set of machines, each group will 
list 1 or more machines that hold some of the data belonging to
that group.

There files are usually in ${HOME}/.diamond but can be in
other places (see diamond documentation).

To run SnapFind, you need to cd to target/bin in the build
tree and run SnapFind from there (due to current limitations in
the loading).

Running a null search will return and display all the images.

To load or save a search is a little tricky.  Searches are named by
the directory not a single config file.  So if you click load search
you will need to go into the directory of the search and click OK.
There is a sample_search in the directory called "sample_search" under
SnapFind.
