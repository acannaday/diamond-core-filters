Building SnapFind
-----------------

Before starting you need to have built and install opencv 0.95.  Snapfind
requires that you build opencv with static libraries.  This can be done
at opencv configuration time by: 

  	./configure --enable-static=yes

To build snapfind you must set the environment variable SNAPFIND_ROOT
to point to the top of the source tree (this should be the directory 
that contains this Intall file).

Then build the system by typing "make".

Assuming the build completes correctly, the binary should be located
in the snapfind directory.  The program is called snapfind.


Running Snapfind
----------------

To run snapfind you must have two configurations files.  The first
is called "gid_map" and the second is called "name_map".  The name_map
groups logical collections of files into one or more group numbers. 
Snapfind allows the user to select the groups id to search.  There must be
at least 1 collection defined.  The gid_map file is used to map
the each group to 1 or more diamond backends.  If running standalone
this should map the group to localhost, if running across a distributed set
of machines, each group will list 1 or more machines.

The default locations of these files is in /usr/local/diamond/etc but
this can be over-ridden by environmental values.
